# 4YFN - MWC Barcelona 2022

## CHALLENGE - Background
Nuwefruit is a startup that seeks to revolutionize the habits of the population by encouraging the consumption of fruit on a daily basis. For this reason, the company specializes in the sale of fruit at home, which thanks to its last mile optimization algorithm allows it to have very low logistics costs. This allows Nuwefruit to sell fruit at a lower price than its competitors. Its catalog is based on the sale of more than 20 types of fruit, which have the best nutritional properties.

## Dataset
Two datasets will be used: the first one contains data on Nuwefruit's customers 'CLIENT TABLE' and the other one contains data on the orders 'ORDERS TABLE' placed by them.
The customer dataset 'CLIENT TABLE' contains the following variables:

## Objectives
1. Make an exploratory analysis of the data that allows to:
   - Analyze sales and customer activity.
   - Evaluate the impact of the promotion
2. Make a predictive model that allows to know the type of segment to which each customer belongs according to the following predictor variables: Download test_x. (The variable (CLIENT_SEGMENT) has to be predicted).

## Thoughts/Comments
It has definitely been a huge challenge for me. At first I started with great enthusiasm because I thought I could do it with R, since I have experience with the language. But I realized days later that it was with Python... which I have no experience at all. 
I tried to do my best. I don't know if in the end I will reach the final or not, but it has been worth all these days of learning.
